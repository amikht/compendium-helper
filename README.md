# Compendium Helper
Compendium Helper is a modern website that uses the information from your Spotify library to build a powerful playlist, representative of your library as a whole, called The Compendium. It is a quick way to generate a playlist that distills down your 'Liked Songs' list into something smaller and more manageable, while still including all the artists (and many of the songs) you know and love.

### How does it work?
Compendium Helper chooses one song from every artist that is represented in your Spotify library, creating a playlist that includes all the genres and all the artists that you love the most.
